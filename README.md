# PowerShell-DNS-Cache-DashboardHow to Use
Save: Save the code above into a file named Create-DnsDashboard.ps1.
Open PowerShell: Open a PowerShell terminal. You might need to run it as an Administrator to get the full DNS cache, although it often works without.
Execution Policy: If you haven't run PowerShell scripts before, you might need to change your execution policy. You can do this for the current session by running:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Use code with caution.
Powershell
Run the Script: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run it:
.\Create-DnsDashboard.ps1
Use code with caution.
Powershell
The script will execute, and a new file dns_dashboard.html will be created in the same directory. Your default web browser will automatically open this file, displaying your interactive dashboard.
